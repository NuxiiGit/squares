Made to prove a point.

This project was written in scratch and converted to HTML using [htmlfier](https://sheeptester.github.io/words-go-here/htmlifier) and uploaded to my website at [nuxiigit.github.io/squares](https://nuxiigit.github.io/squares)

Original project: [The Squares Will Kill You! (Seriously)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76477476)

Original project details:

**Instructions**

This game is point and click, so just whack out your mouse (or mice) and get crackin'.

The aim is to click the squares before they turn red (although, you have a little space where you can still click it and avoid loosing!

The squares will start green and gradually turn red. Not a gradual gradient or anything, that would be too much effort... You'll see.

**Notes and Credits**

I'll probably add difficulties later, because currently you need to have a average dexterity to keep up.
Note: the game isn't broken at 20 assets, I added in a song, and that's the final asset it is loading - Just be patient.

I just had this idea out of the blue.
I copied no scripts, all ideas and blocks are of my own.
The style was inspired by basic arcade games.
